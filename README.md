# RockPaperScissorsV2
Site is live at:

The first version I implemented was prompting the user to input rock, paper, or scissors in text format to play the game against the computer. 
I wanted to apply my new knowledge about DOM manipulation so I redid the project but this time with buttons and text pop ups.
